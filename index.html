                                <p>I am a 2nd Bachelor's student attending Chapman University to learn more about my
                                        passion,
                                        Software Engineering. Before attending Chapman, I graduated from the University
                                        of San
                                        Diego where I got a Bachelorâ€™s in Business Administration (as a pre-med
                                        student). By
                                        graduation, I knew medicine did not excite me enough to want to pursue a career
                                        in the
                                        field. I always had an interest in technology and software, so I attended the
                                        UCI Coding
                                        Bootcamp very soon after graduating from USD.</p>
                                <p>The Bootcamp solidified my realization that computer programming is my passion and
                                        the career
                                        path I want to continue to pursue. I deiced to go back to a 4-year university,
                                        Chapman
                                        University, for a 2nd Bachelor's in Software Engineering to take the opportunity
                                        to
                                        learn more about my newly discovered passion. In addition to attending Chapman,
                                        I have
                                        interned as a software engineer with multiple companies such as Forkaia, Pacific
                                        Life
                                        Insurnace, and now currently HumanID. Please feel welcome to message me on
